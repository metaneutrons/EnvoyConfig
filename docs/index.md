# EnvoyConfig Documentation

## Introduction: What is EnvoyConfig?

EnvoyConfig (EC) is a **lightweight, attribute-driven configuration library** for .NET applications that rely heavily on **environment variables**. It provides a streamlined way to map these variables (from the environment or a `.env` file) onto strongly-typed C# POCOs.

**Core Philosophy:** Simplicity and focus. EnvoyConfig intentionally avoids the complexity of multi-provider configuration systems. If your primary configuration source is the environment, EC offers a direct, type-safe, and dependency-free solution.
